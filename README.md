# It's Scientific!
A resource mod for Factorio

## Overview
This mod adds two new metals (lead and gold) and several new fluids (nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, all derived from compressed air, as well as nitric acid). It also adds a process to double your ore production, though at a steep cost in complexity and energy.

## Nitric Acid Processing
The first step in doubling ores is to research the necessary techs, Air Compression and Nitric Acid Processing. Then, set up a Chemical Plant with the recipe "compress air." It is free, so you won't need to input anything to the laboratory. However, it is a slow and energy-consuming process. Pipe the compressed air into an Oil Refinery set to Separate Air to get nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. You can set the argon aside, as it has no uses yet, and you probably want a buffer tank for the oxygen. Pipe nitrogen and water into a Chemical Plant set to Nitric Acid, then use the nitric acid to Dissolve (Ore) in another Chemical Plant. Finally, pipe the dissolved ore into a last Chemical Plant set to Precipitate (Ore) along with some oxygen and you will get twice the amount of refined metal than you would get via pure smelting.

## Other Recipes
* Quite a few vanilla recipes have been adjusted to require lead or gold instead of iron or copper. These include Basic Bullet Magazines, Piercing Bullet Magazines, Pipes, Basic Armor (only half the cost has been changed), Advanced Circuits, Sulfuric Acid, and Batteries.
* Red Science Packs can (but don't have to) be created using lead gears and gold cable instead of their iron and copper equivalents.
* Once you've researched the Rocket Silo, you can unlock a final tech that allows the creation of Rocket Fuel from nitrogen and water, based off the real-life rocket fuel called hydrazine.
